	    story= _ "On the outskirts of Wesnoth, small dwarvish clans are scattered throughout the mountains, each mining their seams in hopes of discovering the wealth that will allow them to form a hold, elevating the clan√≠s status in dwarvish society.  However, the search for wealth has a cost, and the dwarves were quickly consuming the scraggly trees found in the mountains as their smelters burned day and night."
	[/part]
	[part]
	story=_"As the dwarves pushed out from their settlement to collect more wood, they encountered orcs in the surrounding lowlands.  Content to let the dwarves grub in the dirt for their ores, the orcs were not willing to let the dwarves cut down their forests.  After a few bloody skirmishes, the elders decided it would be best for an expedition to be sent out beyond the orcs to gather wood.  
Unwilling to send out their best warriors for fear of the orcs attacking the settlement, the elders instead chose one of their promising pathfinders, Torgrimfur, a brave but young dwarf."
	[/part]

	[part]
story=_"In accordance with the elders plan, Torgrimfur gathered some fellow dwarfs for his expedition.  As he left the settlement, his mind mulled over how to handle the orcs, as this was a great deal of effort just to get a few logs."
